										<br>Playhouse Theatre
										<br>Overview<br>
										<br>Don’t miss the extraordinary and joyously original Caroline, Or Change, as the five-star,
										<br>Olivier award-winning musical transfers to the West End this November following sell-out 
										<br>runs at the Chichester Festival and Hampstead Theatres.<br>
										<br>Written by Tony Kushner, author of legendary play Angels in America, and with an
										<br>exceptional, soaring score from Tony Award-winning Jeanine Tesori, Caroline, Or Change
										<br>stars Sharon D. Clarke in an astonishing 'virtuoso performance. To watch her seems a 
										<br>privilege' (The Times).<br>
										<br>Louisiana, 1963. Revolution is in the air, though not so much for Caroline, the poorly paid 
										<br>maid toiling endlessly in the sweltering basement of the Gellman household. It’s a 
										<br>fantastical, magical place amidst the piles of laundry and singing washing machines, 
										<br>especially for eight-year-old Noah Gellman who sneaks downstairs to see her whenever he can. 
										<br>Yet a simple gesture to leave more money in Caroline’s pocket is about to test who 
										<br>and how far the winds of change can ever really reach…<br>
										<br>Winner of the Olivier Award for Best New Musical, Caroline, Or Change is a playful, funny,
										<br>and deeply moving tale set to a score that hits new heights of emotion, in a production 
										<br>that always delights with imagination. Directed by Michael Longhurst (Amadeus, Constellations),
										<br>this vital and timely musical opens at the Playhouse Theatre from 20 November 2018 for a strictly limited season.<br>

									<p>
										<br>Overview
										<br>One time I bought a lasagne from the supermarket, heated it up in the oven and ate a bit of it and it wasn't very nice so I put it in the fridge because
										<br>it felt wrong to dump a whole lasagne in the bin and then later on I ate a spoonful of the cold lasagne because I was drunk and it was absolutely delicious. 
										<br>It was 4am. I then changed the name of a WhatsApp I was a part of to COLD LASAGNE HATE MYSELF 1999 because I had been thinking a lot about how 1999 was the 
										<br>best year of my life and also about how much I hate myself sometimes. The next day I was asked to name my new show. Come along.<br>

										<br>Overview<br>
										<br>Romesh is back with a brand new show The Cynic’s Mixtape, his most brutally honest show yet.<br>
										<br>Fresh from the Misadventures of Romesh Ranganathan, A League Of Their Own and Judge Romesh, he's putting showbiz aside to deliver a carefully curated selection of all the things he has found 
										<br>unacceptable since the last tour, including why trying to save the environment is a scam, why none of us are truly free, and his suspicion that his 
										<br>wife is using gluten intolerance to avoid sleeping with him.<br>

									<p>
										<br>Overview<br>
										<br>It has been a while, but the multi-award-winning Welsh comedian is back, with a brand new live show.  In a six-year break from stand-up, a lot has happened to Rhod. 
										<br>Almost all of it s**t.
										<br>And just when he thought he’d hit rock bottom, he met a bloke...called John.
										<br>This show sees Rhod as funny as ever, but like never before.  Raw, personal and brutally honest; no more lies, no more nonsense.<br>
